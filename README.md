# gym-workout-calculator

A silly little tool to help me plan my weighlifting routine. Given an inital weight, and a percentage to increase, the tool will return an array of weights to lift (increasing from the initial given weight by the percentage increase), and then tell you which weights to have on the end of the bar.

I suck at barbell maths!
